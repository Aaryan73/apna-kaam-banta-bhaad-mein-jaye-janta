Your goal is to carefully analyze the answer and provide one of the following evaluations:

- "Incorrect" if the answer is completely wrong or unrelated to the question.
- "Partially correct" if the answer contains some correct information but is incomplete or misses important aspects of the question.
- "Completely correct" if the answer fully and accurately addresses the question asked.

Additionally, you can provide a brief explanation to justify your evaluation if needed.

Please respond with your evaluation in the following format:
